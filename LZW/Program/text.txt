Vitus Behring was born in Denmark in 1681. In 1703, he graduated from the Amsterdam Naval Cadet Corps and soon joined the Russian Navy. In 1724, Peter the Great issued a decree on the organization of an expedition to Kamchatka, which was led by Bering. The first Kamchatka expedition lasted five years. Large sections of the Kamchatka and Chukotka coasts were mapped. By rounding Kamchatka from the south, Russian navigators proved that Kamchatka did not connect with Japan. The most important discovery was that the travelers passed through the strait between Asia and North America. In 1730, he returned to St. Petersburg, where he submitted a detailed report to the Admiralty. After the First expedition, Bering proposed organizing a new, Second Kamchatka expedition to explore the find the eastern sea route to America. His plan was accepted, and he led the Second Kamchatka Expedition. Tumanny Island, another five islands, and the snow Mountains on the Alaska Peninsula were discovered. On November 4, 1741, the ship washed up on the island where Captain-Commander Bering died on December 8. It took a considerable time before Behring's achievements were fully recognized. The Bering Strait, the Bering Sea, Bering Island, the Bering Glacier, and Vitus Lake were all named in his honor.
